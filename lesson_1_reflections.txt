How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
=> "-" showed lines that were no longer in the 2nd file.
=> "+" showed lines that were new to the 2nd file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
=> It would be easier and faster to see where mistakes are introduced or where a better previous solution existed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
=> The pros are that in Git you have control over when to commit and so then it would be easier to go back and find specific changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
=> Git allows saving multiple files in one commit because a group of files can be needed to work together in each successive version.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
=> git log shows you the commit id, description, author and date.
=> git diff shows you what was changed, lines added and lines removed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
=> because you can always revert to the previous unbroken version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
=> Writing Python and Javascript code.
